Because of this, device usage is only allowed during troop meetings with prior approval of the Scoutmaster. Except for those instances where a device has been approved by the Scoutmaster for conducting Troop 212 business, devices should remain out of site, and either off, or with notifications turned completely off. If a scout is observed using a device during a troop meeting at a time not explicitly approved by the Scoutmaster, the device will be placed in a secure location for the remainder of the meeting by an adult leader.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Device Usage During Troop Trips and Outings</span></p><p class="c3"><span>At the discretion of the Tripmaster (the adult leader planning the outing), scouts currently holding a valid Troop 212 Technolgy Chip Honor Card will be allowed to use approved devices at designated times during the trip. In general &ldquo;designated times&rdquo; will be during car rides to and from trips, and at brief, predetermined intervals during the mornings or evenings for the purposes of conducting troop business or for communicating with family. At all other times during the trip, device usage is not allowed (except as noted below for the SPL). If it is determined that devices are being used inappropriately during a trip, devices will be collected and placed in a secure location with either the Tripmaster or Scoutmaster.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>For the purposes of communicating with adult leaders and conducting troop business during the trip, t</span><span>he SPL (or acting SPL) shall have the privilege of using devices throughout the trip, provided usage is consistent with the Troop 212 Technology Chip Pledge.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">A Note about device charging on trips: </span><span>Electricity is a very scarce resource at most of the campsites that the troop visits. Unless instructed otherwise by the Tripmaster or Scoutmaster, the charging of devices at camp facilities is not allowed for any scout other than the SPL. Concerns about charging of devices takes away from the intent of a trip, can be a distraction, and is a potential source of conflict due to the scarcity of electric receptacles. If a scout is concerned about having enough charge to use his device during approved times during a trip, he should take care to turn the phone completely off when not in use (in other words, </span><span class="c6">most of the trip</span><span>).</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Consequences of Violation of Technology Usage Policy</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Qualified scouts who violate the Technology Usage Policy on more than two occasions will have their privileges revoked for a period of time determined by the Scoutmaster.
